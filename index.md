1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
   
   The most interesting topic covered in my domain thsi year is how much data a device like apple watch hold about our daily health metrics. I found it interesting how visualising and organising a person's everyday data can help them and clinicians understand their possible undiagnosed diseases better!

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
   A potential investigation could be to see if this data can be combined with higher level tests like blood tests, ECG's, PET scans (if all of it exists) to make a deeper connection and making it clearer for clinicians to understand the undiagnosed diseases. 

3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
   A potential change I'd make to the approach taken in Q1 Project is to find more data and simaltaneously work with the existing data/dummy data to create pipelines for the dashboard. I would also try to think of this project in a more usable, commercial, and beneficial setting as if I were to open a startup with this product.  

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
  I would be interested to create more features using existing features through statistics and mathematics. I would also like to learn new technologies while completing the project!
